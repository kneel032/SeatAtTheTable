        <h3>How This Started</h3>
        <p>
            I am of the strong belief that if I see a problem and have a means of solving any part of it, I must.
            There isn't much I know with certainty, but I know with everything in me that food is a human right, it is
            rich with history and science and culture and community. I've been around a chef my entire life and have 
            picked up on some cooking techniques here and there and as I personally grow to return my body and spirit
            to the natural rhythyms of the Earth that have gotten me here in the first place, food has only become even 
            more important.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page serves as a central point first and foremost for connecting excess food to those who
            need it. There is a manufactured food crisis and although we did not start it, I believe we will be have to be 
            responsible for solving it. This is my first attempt at just that. Beyond that, there are recipes I've
            cooked with that focus on reducing food waste to begin with, stretching a dollar, and how to get the most
            out of your meals. Beyond that, other things I've learned in the kitchen are in it's own place as they 
            still relate to cooking but maybe not so much the act of eating the food itself. Lastly, because this 
            is also a passion project of mine and I have a lot I want to say, my thoughts are kept separate in a blog. 
            Topics will all relate to food, but will cover the range of SHTEAM, an acronym I've started using which stands 
            for "Science, Humanities, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math". You may be thinking, isn't this 
            pretty much everything you could cover in relation to food? And the answer is yes. And that's the point.
            Nothing happens in a vacuum so things should not be shared or taught or talked about as such. The chemistry
            of cooking has affected the history of its use which has impacted the policies and politics of it today. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing here is meant to be a final version or the only version. I may be flat out wrong in other cases. Beyond 
            trying to serve my community and make sure everyone is fed, I'm here to inspire: a stronger community, new ways of 
            doing things, new recipes, new art, new ways of thinking, any of it and all of it.
